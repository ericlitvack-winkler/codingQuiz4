CamelCase:
- Time Complexity: nlog(n) because there is a for loop going to the length of the string, and inside the for loop is a contains function which is likely log(n).
- Space Complexity: Constant, since only constant variables are stored.

Correctness and the Loop Invariant
- Time Complexity: n^2 because of the while loop nested in a for loop.
- Space Complexity: Constant, because there are a few constant variables defined and then all other operations are stored in the original array.
